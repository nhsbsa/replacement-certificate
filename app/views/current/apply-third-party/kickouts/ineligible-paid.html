      <h1>You cannot apply for a PRC</h1>

      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">
        You cannot use this service to apply for a PRC as you've told us that you've paid more than a co-payment or patient contribution for your treatment.
      </p>

      <p>You need to pay the full amount of treatment costs and then claim a refund.</p>

      <h2>Claiming a refund</h2>

      <p>Depending on the country you visit, you may be expected to pay all or part of your bill upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.</p>
      
      <p>You can claim back the difference between the total bill and the co-payment, but the actual co-payment is not refundable.</p>
      <p>You should keep all invoices, receipts, and any other paperwork. You or your insurance company may need them if you apply for a refund.</p>
      <p>To request a refund, you'll need to <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us">contact us</a>. </p>
